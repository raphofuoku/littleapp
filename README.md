# Little Lemon Restaurant - Reserve a Table Feature

This project is part of the Meta Frontend Developer Professional Certificate. It focuses on adding a "Reserve a Table" feature to the Little Lemon Restaurant website. This feature allows customers to book a table online, entering the necessary details through an easy-to-use form.

## Project Overview

The Little Lemon restaurant website was enhanced by incorporating a table reservation feature. I designed the homepage and the reservation feature using Figma before implementing them using React.js. The main focus of the project is to deliver a seamless user experience where customers can reserve a table at the restaurant by providing essential information.

### `Key Features:`

* Homepage Design: Created a visually appealing homepage for Little Lemon, showcasing the restaurant's offerings.
* Reservation Form: Built a form for users to input their booking details, including:
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Phone Number
    * Email Address
    * Number of Guests
    * Reservation Date and Time
    * Occasion
    * Special Requests

### `Technologies Used:`

* Figma: Designed the homepage and the reservation feature before development.
* React.js: Built the website and the reservation feature, utilizing functional components and hooks.
* HTML5 & CSS3: Structured and styled the web pages for a responsive layout.
* JavaScript (ES6): Added interactivity and form handling for the reservation feature.
